# RomM Hash Matcher

This is a small program i threw together to match hashes of roms in your RomM Server to a database of known hashes, RomM developer plan on adding this as a native feature but until then you can use this and manually do it once to match unmatched RomM automatically (this works best when your rom is matching an entry from known DAT Groups like No-Intro, Redump, TOSEC etc)
